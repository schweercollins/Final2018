## Nhanes 2015-2016 instructions

The code chunk below explains the nhanes and the other packages that are needed and how to load the data.

``` {r nhanes data, echo = FALSE}

# install.packages("nhanesA")
# install.packages("naniar")

library(nhanesA)
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
library(here)
library(janitor)
theme_set(theme_classic())
```
The nhanesA package lets you import data directly from the CDC website on nhanes data. The code below will import data and I have created an object for it to be loaded to.

Below are examples of data from the 2015-2016 datasets.

You can also view the data but be prepared for your computer to take a while since it takes so long to download all the data.

It might be best to just view the data on the [nhanes website](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/PAQ_I.htm) and then create an object with the specific variables we want to look at.

** Note: We could also look at visuals between the years since many of these variables reappear throughout all the years. **

[nhanes datasets by different years](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Default.aspx)

``` {r load_data, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
