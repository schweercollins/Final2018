#R ScaRy JouRney

![get it](get_it.jpg)

We were interested in using a publicly-available dataset that could translate our skills as researchers and data scientists. 

The dataset that came to mind was the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset.

We decided on the 2015-2016 years because it was the most recent data collected.

---
#Why did we use this data?
--

1. it is a widely used dataset for researchers in several fields
--

2. has a wide variety of biofeedback, self-report, and other measures of health constructs
--

3. It has a large sample to draw from
--

4. taught us how to navigate bigger datasets
--

5. but the real reason is because I apparently like to make things harder than they have to be.

#Variables used

For our project we decided on several variables including:

1. depressive symptoms
2. insurance (yes/no)
3. race/ethnicity
4. sex
5. education
6. income
7. seeking mental health services (yes/no)
8. if individuals have been to rehab (yes/no)
9. age
10. age which began using substances (marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth)

# So how did we do this

Just a little ![imagination](imagination.jpg)

But seriously...
If you try to download NHANES data right now, you get SAS files in `.xpt` files. 

This makes you have to download a file reader from their website. It's really just a huge mess.

---
# Our plan
So after some thinking 

![coffee](spongebob_coffee.gif) 

We found the `nhanesA` [package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nhanesA/nhanesA.pdf).

---
This lets you download files straight to *R* without having to use `rio` or `here`.

It was a great resource and the most basic function was to create an object and type in the dataframe to view data straight from the nhanes website.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#huq_i <- nhanes('HUQ_I')
```

Or so we thought.

# Victories and Challenges
---
# Maria's Victories and Challenges No.1

Challenge: Downloading and merging multiple dataframes from NHANES

```{r example}
#library(nhanesA)

#Mental health services measure
#huq_i <- nhanes('HUQ_I')

#Health insurance measure
#hiq_i <- nhanes('HIQ_I')

```
--

*Victory: We merged these files after first converting to CSV files* 


```{r merge}
#write.csv(duq_i, "duq_i.csv")

#import csv files
#duq_i <- import(here("data", "duq_i.csv"), 
#                 setclass = "tbl_df")
#demo_i <- import(here("data", "demo_i.csv"),
#                 setclass = "tbl_df")
#merge
#d <- merge(duq_i,demo_i, by = "V1")
```
---
# Maria's Victories and Challenges No.2

Challenge: Using our new and unrefined Github skills to work collaboratively on this final project 

--

*Victory: We were creative in our initial problem-solving* 

--
1. We met on campus in a room with a projector 

--
2. We took turns pulling and pushing the main project file from Github   

--
3. We problem-solved code on one person's screen as a team

```{r td, echo = FALSE}
td1 %>% 
  select(1:5, 9:11) %>% 
  arrange(desc(age_heroin)) %>% 
  head(n = 4)
```
--
*Victory: Creating a tidy dataset that could plot variables by different drug types*
```{r plot_code, eval = FALSE}
td1 %>% 
  select(1, 3:6) %>% 
  gather(drug, age_use, 2:5) %>% 
  separate(drug, c("dis", "drug"), sep = "_") %>%

  na.omit()
```

# Alejandra's Victories and Challenges No.1

Challenge: Not remembering the order of actions to pull/push commits on GitHub. 

Victory: I wrote them down and I have almost memorized them!

--
1. Pull to make sure you are working on the latest version of the project.

--
2. Work on your project.

--
3. Save your work.

--
4. Stage what you are pushing.

--
5. Write a brief message so everyone knows about your updates.

--
6. Commit.

--
6. Push.

--
7. Pray that no merging conflicts occur.

# Alejandra's Victories and Challenges No.4

Challenge: Not liking the default theme of the slides using the `xaringan` package. 

Victory: Succesfully changing the theme by adding just a line of code and learning other nifty tricks to make the slides cooler. 

```{r}

# Alejandra's Victories and Challenges No.5

Challenge: Not knowing how to visualize more than one categorical variable at a time.

Victory: Figuring out how to do it by combining fill and facet_wrap.

td1 %>% 
  mutate(ethnicity = fct_infreq(ethnicity)) %>%
  group_by(ethnicity) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ethnicity, y = sum_depression)) +
  geom_col(fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  facet_wrap(~ sex)

```

```{r using fill & facer_wrap2, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

td1 %>%

#Ongoing Challenges

- Using the `Papaja` package to do the write-up of the project

- Substantially more participants reported cocaine use without receiveing rehab services.
- The majority started using drugs around 15-25, regardless of drug type.

```

- Those who start using stimulants earlier are more likely to have lower depression scores, compared to those who start using later.
- The opposite was observed for heroin use.

#R Hurdles to Tackle
###Shaina
Become familiar with Rmd presentation options (e.g., images, animations, emojis, memes, layouts)
###Maria
utilize papaja more in academic writing and build a website using R and/or use github to share research presentations
---
#R Hurdles to Tackle
###Alejandra
Manage my anxiety, continue to learn the R language and being able to completely ditch SPSS and use only R!

###JP
further my knowledge of analyses in R (e.g., lavaan) through the datacamp modules and to learn more base r coding
